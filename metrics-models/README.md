# Ecosystem Evaluation System

Ecosystem is used to describe the health status of open source community standing from ecology context. We create three top level dimensions: Productivity, Robustness and Niche Creation. 

# Dimensions

## [**Productivity**](./productivity/README.md)
Definition: The efficiency with which an ecosystem or project converts inputs into output.

Metrics Model Names | Descriptions 
--- | --- 
[Code Quality Guarantee ](./productivity/code/code-quality-guarantee.md#code-quality-guarantee) | Code, as the final output of a project, is the essence of the entire community's contribution. Code quality guarantee is the measurement of how to guarantee software quality using multiple proxies.
[Code Security Guarantee](./productivity/code/code-security-guarantee.md#code-security-guarantee) | Coming soon!
[Code Compliance Guarantee](./productivity/code/code-compliance-guarantee.md#code-compliance-guarantee) | Coming soon!
[Content](./productivity/content.md#content) | Coming soon!
[Community Service and Support](./productivity/community-service-and-support.md#community-service-and-support) | It measures the quality of services and support provided by the community as directly perceived by a developer during the contribution process.

## [**Robustness**](./robustness/README.md)
Definition: The capability of an ecosystem or project to face and survive disruptions.

Metrics Model Names | Descriptions 
--- | --- 
[Activity](./robustness/activity.md#activity) | Community Activity is used to describe how active an open source community is.
[Developer Convertion](./robustness/developer/developer-convertion.md#developer-convertion) | Coming soon!
[Developer Retention](./robustness/developer/developer-retention.md#developer-retention) | Coming soon!
[Inner Connectedness](./robustness/organization/innner-connectedness.md#inner-connectedness) | Coming soon!
[Organization Collaboration Relationships](./robustness/organization/organization-collaboration-relationships.md#organization-collaboration-relationships) | Coming soon!
[Outbound Connectedness](./robustness/organization/outbound-connectedness.md) | Coming soon!


## [**Niche Creation**](./niche-creation/README.md)
Definition: The capacity to create and recognize meaningful diversity and thereby new capabilities.

Metrics Model Names | Descriptions 
--- | --- 
[Developer Attraction](./niche-creation/ecological-diversity/developer-attraction.md#developer-attraction) | Coming soon!
[Organizations Activity](./niche-creation/ecological-diversity/organization-activity.md#organizations-activity) | It is used to describe how active organizations are in a community.
[Technological Advancement](./niche-creation/technological-advancement.md#technological-advancement) | Coming soon!
