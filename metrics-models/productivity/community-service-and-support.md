# Metric Model Algorithm

## Weight

We use [AHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process) to calculate weight of each metric.

### AHP Input Data

Close PR Count        |   1.000 |  1.000 | 1.333 | 1.500 | 1.500 | 2.000 | 2.000
Issue First Response |   0.750 | 0.750 | 1.000 | 1.143 | 1.143 | 1.333 | 1.333
Bug Issue Open Time |    0.667 | 0.667 | 0.875 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.250 | 1.250
PR Open Time        |     0.667 | 0.667 | 0.875 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.250 | 1.250
Comment Frequency  |     0.500 | 0.500 | 0.750 | 0.800 | 0.800 | 1.000 | 1.000
Code Review Count  |     0.500 | 0.500 | 0.750 | 0.800 | 0.800 | 1.000 | 1.000
